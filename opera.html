        <pre>SCENE — Outer Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant.  Melissa,
            SachaRissa, and ladies discovered, armed with
            battleaxes.

                                   CHORUS
                           "Death to the Invader!"


         <h4>MLS</h4>     <P>Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
                       We're instructed to display;
                 But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                       We are more inclined to say,
                 "Please you, do not hurt us,"</P>

          <h4>ALL</h4>        <P> "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"</P>

         <h4>MLS</h4>        <P>"Please you let us be."</P>
         <h4>ALL</h4>         <p> "Let us be — let us be!"</P>

       <h4>MLS</h4>    <P>"Soldiers disconcert us."</P>

       <h4>ALL</h4>      <P>"Disconcert us, if it please you!"</P>

       <h4>MLS</h4>         <P>"Frighten'd maids are we!"</P>

       <h4>ALL</h4>                 <P>"Maids are we, maids are we!"</P>

       <h4>MLS</h4>        <p>Please you,</P>

       <h4>ALL</h4>         <p>Do not hurt us;</P>

      <h4>MLS</h4>        <P>Please you,</P>

      <h4>ALL</h4>                   <P>Let us be</P>

      <h4>M&C</h4>        <P>Frighten'd maids are we, frighten'd maids are we!</P>

      <h4>MLS</h4>         <P>But 'twould be an error
                 To confess our terror,
                 So in Ida's name,
                 Boldly we exclaim:</P>
