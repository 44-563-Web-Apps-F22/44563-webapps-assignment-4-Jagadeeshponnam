               Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
               Wear naught but what is necessary to
               Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
               And give your limbs full play.</p>

        <P class="speech3"> One moment, ma'am,
               Here is a paradox we should not pass
               Without inquiry.  We are prone to say
               "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
               Yet they invariably co-exist!
               We find the Needful comprehended in
               The circle of the grand Superfluous,
               Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
               Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
               These singular considerations are—.</P>

    <h4 class="MLS">MLS.</h4>    
        <p class="speech1">Superfluous, yet not Needful — so you see
               The terms may independently exist.
    <p class="direction" >(To Ladies) </p>     
        <p class="speech2"> Women of Adamant, we have to show
               That women, educated to the task,
               Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground,
               And beat him there.  Now, let us set to work;
               Where is our lady surgeon?.</P>
